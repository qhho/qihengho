I am a PhD Candidate in aerospace engineering sciences at the University of Colorado Boulder. I am advised by Morteza Lahijanian and Zachary Sunberg. My research interests lie at the intersection of formal methods and planning under uncertainty. My goal is to enable safety-critical autonomous *partially observable cyber-physical systems* *under uncertainty* to complete complex temporal tasks while providing explicit guarantees on their safety and operational properties.
