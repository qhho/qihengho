I am a PhD Student in aerospace engineering sciences at the University of Colorado Boulder. I am advised by Morteza Lahijanian and Zachary Sunberg. My research lies in the intersection of formal methods and planning under uncertainty for robots. My goal is to enable safety-critical autonomous systems under uncertainty to complete complex temporal tasks while providing operational guarantees on their safety and liveness properties.
