I am a PhD Student in aerospace engineering sciences at the University of Colorado Boulder. I am advised by Morteza Lahijanian and Zachary Sunberg. My research interests lie at the intersection of formal methods and planning under uncertainty. My goal is to enable safety-critical autonomous robotic systems under uncertainty to complete complex temporal tasks while providing explicit guarantees on their safety and operatonal properties.
