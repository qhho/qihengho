abstract: Autonomous urban driving among human-driven cars requires a holistic
  understanding of road rules, driver intents and driving styles. This is
  challenging as a short-term, single instance, driver intent of lane change may
  not correspond to their driving styles for a longer duration. This paper
  presents an interactive behavior planner which accounts for road context,
  short-term driver intent, and long-term driving style to infer beliefs over
  the latent states of surrounding vehicles. We use a specialized Partially
  Observable Markov Decision Process to provide risk-averse decisions.
  Specifically, we consider adversarial driving scenarios caused by irrational
  drivers to validate the robustness of our proposed interactive behavior
  planner in simulation as well as on a full-size self-driving car. Our
  experimental results show that our algorithm enables safer and more travel
  time-efficient autonomous driving compared to baselines even in adversarial
  scenarios.
