abstract: This paper presents a new multi-layered algorithm for motion planning
  under motion and sensing uncertainties for Linear Temporal Logic
  specifications. We propose a technique to guide a sampling-based search tree
  in the combined task and belief space using trajectories from a simplified
  model of the system, to make the problem computationally tractable. Our method
  eliminates the need to construct fine and accurate finite abstractions. We
  prove correctness and probabilistic completeness of our algorithm, and
  illustrate the benefits of our approach on several case studies. Our results
  show that guidance with a simplified belief space model allows for significant
  speed-up in planning for complex specifications.
