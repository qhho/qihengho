abstract: We consider the problem of autonomous navigation using limited
  information from a remote sensor network. Because the remote sensors are power
  and bandwidth limited, we use event-triggered (ET) estimation to manage
  communication costs. We introduce a fast and efficient sampling-based planner
  which computes motion plans coupled with ET communication strategies that
  minimize communication costs, while satisfying constraints on the probability
  of reaching the goal region and the point-wise probability of collision. We
  derive a novel method for offline propagation of the expected state
  distribution, and corresponding bounds on this distribution. These bounds are
  used to evaluate the chance constraints in the algorithm. Case studies
  establish the validity of our approach, demonstrating fast computation of
  optimal plans.
