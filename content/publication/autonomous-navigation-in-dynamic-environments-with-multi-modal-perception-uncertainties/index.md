abstract: This paper addresses the safe path planning problem for autonomous
  mobility with multi-modal perception uncertainties. Specifically, we assume
  that different sensor inputs lead to different Gaussian process regulated
  perception uncertainties (named as multi-modal perception uncertainties). We
  implement a Bayesian inference algorithm, which merges the multi-modal
  GP-regulated uncertainties into a unified one and translates the unified
  uncertainty into a dynamic risk map. With the safe path planner taking the
  risk map as input, we are able to plan a safe path for the autonomous vehicle
  to follow. Experimental results on an autonomous golf cart testbed validate
  the applicability and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.
