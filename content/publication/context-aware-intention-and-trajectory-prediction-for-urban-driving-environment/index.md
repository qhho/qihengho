abstract: "This paper addresses intention and trajectory prediction of
  exo-vehicles in an urban driving environment. Urban environments pose
  challenging scenarios for self-driving cars, specifically pertaining to
  traffic light detection, negotiating paths at the intersections and sometimes
  even overtaking illegally parked cars in narrow streets. This complex task of
  autonomously driving while considering anomalous situations make urban driving
  conditions unique when compared to highway driving. In order to overcome these
  challenges, we propose to use road contextual information to predict driving
  intentions and trajectories of surrounding vehicles. The intention prediction
  is obtained using a recurrent neural network and the trajectory is predicted
  using a polynomial model fitting of the past lateral and longitudinal
  components of the vehicle poses and road contextual information. The
  integrated process of intention and trajectory prediction is performed in
  real-time by deploying and testing on a self-driving car in a real urban
  environment. "
