abstract: In this work, we present a novel robustness measure for
  continuous-time stochastic trajectories with respect to Signal Temporal Logic
  (STL) specifications. We show the soundness of the measure and develop a
  monitor for reasoning about partial trajectories. Using this monitor, we
  introduce an STL sampling-based motion planning algorithm for robots under
  uncertainty. Given a minimum robustness requirement, this algorithm finds
  satisfying motion plans; alternatively, the algorithm also optimizes for the
  measure. We prove probabilistic completeness and asymptotic optimality of the
  motion planner with respect to the measure, and demonstrate the effectiveness
  of our approach on several case studies.
