abstract: We present a novel autonomous driving system which uses the road
  contextual information and intentions of other road users for urban driving.
  Unlike highways, urban environments require the drivers to follow traffic
  signs and signals while using their best judgment for anomalous situations. In
  such scenarios, a self-driving car needs to understand and take into account
  the uncertainties in the environment to plan and decide its action
  accordingly. Our planner models the intentions of the surrounding vehicles
  leveraging a neural network, and integrates the road contextual information to
  reduce its environment uncertainties and also speed up the decision making
  process. We validate our planner in simulation and in a real urban
  environment. Our experimental results show that integrating intention
  inference and road contextual information for prediction, planning and
  decision making help improve safety and efficiency of our autonomous driving
  system.
